\section*{Data}
The primary data employed are located menu expenditures, which contain the yearly allotted allocations from Aldermen and their respective locations from 2005 to 2022.
This dataset comes from Menu spending reports that are publicly available from 2011 through 2022, and records that were not previously publicly available that were obtained through a FOIA request to Chicago's office of budget and management \cite{OBM_datasource}.  
I then scraped these PDFs and used the resulting cost total, ward, and location description data to create map of shapes of the locations of the expenditures.
I then used the location description text to to locate the described vertices of each project using the Census' geocoding API. 
If the census's API failed, google maps' API would be used instead.
For example, spending on playground equipment would be a singular point, while spending on a street would be a line, and spending of all alleys within a given block would be a polygon.
This dataset contain 41,381 precinct-year observations which record the total amount of spending in a given voting precinct in a given year.
