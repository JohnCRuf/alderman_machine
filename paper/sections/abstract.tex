    In numerous urban political systems, the reality of patronage clashes with theoretical predictions that marginal voters determine policy outcomes. This paper examines the role of patronage
    using novel data from Chicago’s menu program, where city council members distribute public
    goods in their wards using a fixed budget. 
    I start with the case of Alderman Bernie Stone whom citizens alleged of under-providing precincts where he lost. 
    I find strong evidence of a spending shift towards his opponents from his supporters after his removal from office. 
    Next, I investigate if this is a broader issue using two differences-in-differences approaches. 
    I find no significant shift comparing incumbent aldermen who barely won and lost reelection. 
    Comparing indicted aldermen to “entrenched” aldermen shows a notable spending shift, albeit the results are sensitive.
    Precincts that supported an indicted alderman saw a 1.14\% spending decrease, while opposing precincts saw a 2.59\% increase, creating a \$56,000 annual gap.
