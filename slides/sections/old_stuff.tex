    Voters get utility from politician competence, the state of the infrastructure stock, and ``conspicuous expenditures''
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Voters know their utility and infrastructure stock, but not the politician's competence or the ``conspicuous expenditures''
        \item Imagine conspicuous expenditures as faking competence
        \item Politicians get more competent over time
        \item Voters then form expectations about politicians' competence taking into account expected conspicuous expenditures and infrastructure stock
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Politicians know they'll be more competent next period
            \item So to secure votes less experienced politicians will spend more on conspicuous expenditures
            \item But can still be kicked out by a large enough shock to the infrastructure stock
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
